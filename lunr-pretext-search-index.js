Answer:                     Decide whether is a solution to the system of equations     Yes    No          If a point is a solution to a system of linear equations, it implies the point is on both lines.  To decide whether a given point is a solution to a system of equations or not, we need to know whether or not the point is on both lines.  Substituting the point into the first equation, we have:   This is true, so is on the line .  Next, we substitute into the second equation, and we have:   This is also true, so is on the line .  Since is on both lines, is a solution tp the system of equations.

  "body": " Sage Reference  We have introduced a number of Sage commands throughout the text, and the most important ones are summarized here in a single place.    Accessing Sage  In addition to the Sage cellls included throughout the book, there are a number of ways to access Sage.  There is a freely available Sage cell at .  You can save your Sage work by creating an account at and working in a Sage worksheet.  There is a page of Sage cells at . The results obtained from evaluating one cell are available in other cells on that page. However, you will lose any work once the page is reloaded.    Creating matrices  There are a couple of ways to create matrices. For instance, the matrix can be created in either of the two following ways.    matrix(3, 4, [-2, 3, 0, 4, 1,-2, 1,-3, 0, 2, 3, 0])      matrix([ [-2, 3, 0, 4], [ 1,-2, 1,-3], [ 0, 2, 3, 0] ])      Be aware that Sage can treat mathematically equivalent matrices in different ways depending on how they are entered. For instance, the matrix matrix([ [1, 2], [2, 1] ]) has integer entries while matrix([ [1.0, 2.0], [2.0, 1.0] ]) has floating point entries.  If you would like the entries to be considered as floating point numbers, you can include RDF in the definition of the matrix. matrix(RDF, [ [1, 2], [2, 1] ])     Special matrices  The identity matrix can be created with identity_matrix(4) A diagonal matrix can be created from a list of its diagonal entries. For instance, diagonal_matrix([3,-4,2])     Reduced row echelon form  The reduced row echelon form of a matrix can be obtained using the rref() function. For instance, A = matrix([ [1,2], [2,1] ]) A.rref()     Vectors  A vector is defined by listing its components. v = vector([3,-1,2])     Addition  The + operator performs vector and matrix addition. v = vector([2,1]) w = vector([-3,2]) print(v+w)  A = matrix([[2,-3],[1,2]]) B = matrix([[-4,1],[3,-1]]) print(A+B)     Multiplication  The * operator performs scalar multiplication of vectors and matrices. v = vector([2,1]) print(3*v) A = matrix([[2,1],[-3,2]]) print(3*A)   Similarly, the * is used for matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication. A = matrix([[2,-3],[1,2]]) v = vector([2,1]) print(A*v) B = matrix([[-4,1],[3,-1]]) print(A*B)     Operations on vectors     The length of a vector v is found using v.norm() .    The dot product of two vectors v and w is v*w .       Operations on matrices    The transpose of a matrix A is obtained using either A.transpose() or A.T .    The inverse of a matrix A is obtained using either A.inverse() or A^-1 .    The determinant of A is A.det() .    A basis for the null space is found with A.right_kernel() .    Pull out a column of A using, for instance, A.column(0) , which returns the vector that is the first column of A .    The command A.matrix_from_columns([0,1,2]) returns the matrix formed by the first three columns of A .       Eigenvectors and eigenvalues     The eigenvalues of a matrix A can be found with A.eigenvalues() . The number of times that an eigenvalue appears in the list equals its multiplicity.    The eigenvectors of a matrix having rational entries can be found with A.eigenvectors_right() .    If can be diagonalized as , then D, P = A.right_eigenmatrix() provides the matrices D and P .    The characteristic polynomial of A is A.charpoly('x') and its factored form A.fcp('x') .       Matrix factorizations     The factorization of a matrix P, L, U = A.LU() gives matrices so that .    A singular value decomposition is obtained with U, Sigma, V = A.SVD() It's important to note that the matrix must be defined using RDF . For instance, A = matrix(RDF, 3,2,[1,0,-1,1,1,1]) .    The factorization of A is A.QR() provided that A is defined using RDF .        "
